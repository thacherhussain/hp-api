# Harry Potter API

A simple JSON-based API for getting information on Harry Potter characters to use for dummy endpoints when first starting personal project applications.

Hosted at http://potterverse-v2.herokuapp.com

Project forked from the [hp-api](https://github.com/bethfraser/hp-api) repo because this data file is hella complete and way more comprehensive than the one when I wrote with my first potterverse API. It's more fun to learn new things if you have an API where you can manipulate the calls as needed and my last one was waaaaaay out of date.
